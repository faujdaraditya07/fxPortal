## NFT Collection Deployment and Transfer Project

Welcome to the NFT Collection Deployment and Transfer project! In this project, you will deploy an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, map the collection to Polygon, and transfer assets over via the Polygon Bridge. Additionally, you will use an image generation tool like DALL-E 2 or Midjourney to create the images for your NFTs, adding a unique twist to the project.

## Project Overview

- Generate a 5-item collection using DALL-E 2 or Midjourney.
- Store items on IPFS using pinata.cloud.
- Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
- Implement a `promptDescription` function on the contract to return the prompt used to generate the images.
- Map your NFT collection using the Polygon network token mapper for visualization.
- Write a Hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs. (Hint: ERC721A is optimal here.)
- Write a Hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge.
- Approve the NFTs to be transferred.
- Deposit the NFTs to the Bridge.
- Test `balanceOf` on Mumbai.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up your environment variables, including your Ethereum and Polygon network RPC URLs, private keys, and Pinata API key.
4. Ensure you have sufficient testnet ETH and MATIC tokens for deployment and testing.

## Steps to Deploy and Transfer NFTs

1. **Generate NFT Images**: Use DALL-E 2 or Midjourney to create a 5-item collection of NFT images.
2. **Store Images on IPFS**: Upload the generated images to IPFS using Pinata Cloud and obtain the corresponding IPFS URLs.
3. **Deploy Smart Contract**: Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. Make sure to include the `promptDescription` function in the contract.
4. **Map NFT Collection to Polygon**: Use the Polygon network token mapper to map your NFT collection for visualization purposes.
5. **Batch Mint NFTs**: Write and execute a Hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs onto the Ethereum Testnet.
6. **Batch Transfer NFTs to Polygon**: Write and execute a Hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge.
7. **Approve NFT Transfers**: Approve the NFTs to be transferred from Ethereum to Polygon.
8. **Deposit NFTs to Bridge**: Deposit the approved NFTs to the Bridge for transfer to Polygon.
9. **Test BalanceOf**: Test the `balanceOf` function on the Polygon Mumbai network to ensure successful transfer.
